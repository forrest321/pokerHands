# pokerHands

This library contains a poker hand evaluator written in pure go, with no external dependencies.  There were several 
packages already available that could do this, but they used large lookup tables or confusing bitwise operations.  
I wanted something more readable, so I created this package.

Currently, pokerHands only handles 5 card hands, but it is possible to add more game types in the future.
